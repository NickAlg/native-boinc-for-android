Building the target doc, e.g. "make doc" should build PDF
documentation if texinfo is found.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dependencies:
  Everything can be built independently of BOINC for separate use

  separation: Only BOINC if necessary
       Recommend using BOINC from submodule
       For OpenCL: OpenCL from AMD APP SDK or Nvidia CUDA SDK

  nbody:
    OpenSSL: Optional, only used for tests
    GLUT, OpenGL: Optional, for building graphics

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dependency Installation Notes:

    Linux:
        Ubuntu / Debian:
              - Make sure the necessary build tools are installed

              $ apt-get build-essential
              $ apt-get install cmake git-core diffutils patch libssl-dev freeglut3-dev

          Other Distributions: Install equivalent packages.

    OS X:
                - Install Xcode and the Apple developer tools. This may involve joining some sort of cult.
                - Install macports

                $ port install cmake git-core

                To build as 32 bit, there are 2 options.

                If using Apple GCC,
                - To build as 32 bit, or as a universal binary (no PPC), build with
                  -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS="-m32" -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-m32"
                 - 32 bit OS X  build may require Apple GCC 4.0 and  the 10.4u SDK

               -If using Macports GCC, make sure you've installed the
                +universal variant. Then build normally with the addition of -DCMAKE_C_FLAG="-m32" -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-m32" This however won't work on 10.4


    Windows:
        - Visual Studio 2010 should work for Separation, but not will
           not work with N-body with crlibm. It should build without crlibm however.

        - MinGW: Try using TDM-GCC http://tdm-gcc.tdragon.net/
      - build with -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local for some reason
          helps find things with MinGW

       -If you are trying to build a 32-bit version which will work on  Windows 2000 you must configure with the option
        MSVC32_AVX_WORKAROUND enabled, and then manually set the platform toolset to each target in VS to v90.


        Install OpenSSL for Win64:
          - Install MSVC++ redistributables:
               http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=bd2a6171-e2d6-4230-b809-9a8d7548c1b6
          - Install OpenSSL itself:
               http://www.slproweb.com/download/Win64OpenSSL-1_0_0d.exe

          - Copy these: DLLs from their default install location
               C:\OpenSSL-Win64\libeay32.dll
               C:\OpenSSL-Win64\ssleay32.dll
               to milkywayathome_client\lib directory to avoid finding
               the 32 bit libraries.

          - For MSVC 32 bit, either use VS 2008 or at least install
            it, and set the platform toolset to v90 for all targets
            (for now at least it can't be set from cmake) or else it
            won't run on Windows 2000 (anything before XP SP2)

     FreeBSD:
       - Building 32 bit is sort of broken on 64 bit, so in addition
            to -m32, you need to add -B/usr/lib32 to your flags
     - /proc must be mounted for Lua to work which seems to not happen
          by default
     - Undefined reference from BOINC stuff on 32 bit I'm too lasy to figure out now


BOINC:
    If building from git, you can build BOINC along with everything else
    using a submodule:

    $ git checkout <tag of desired version>
       e.g. $ git checkout separation_0.80
     $ git submodule init
     $ git submodule update

     - Without a submodule, dropping a copy of the BOINC source at
     milkywayathome_client/boinc/boinc should also include BOINC in the
     build.

     - If BOINC isn't found there, it will try to find the BOINC libraries
     installed on the system or dumped in include and lib in the binary directory

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Using Build Options:
  Build options are passed to cmake with -D on the command line, or
  are check boxes if using the GUI

   Example options:
    $ cmake . -DBOINC_APPLICATION=OFF -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang

 Using -i argument with cmake will walk you through various build options

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Build Options:

Common ON/OFF options:
    BOINC_APPLICATION: Build with BOINC or not. More convenient to not
                                        use BOINC for general use, testing. Not useful for most people
    BOINC_RELEASE_NAMES: Use the long names BOINC uses which include version and system information

Build Options:
  CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE = one of Release, RelWithDebInfo, MinSizeRel, or Profile
                                      defaults to Release
             Some of the libraries the build handles (popt, lua, and BOINC) default to MinSizeRel unless debugging

Common system options:
  CMAKE_C_FLAGS, CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS - compiler flags
  CMAKE_C_COMPILER, CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER - specify compiler
    - note that if you want to change the compiler, you must delete CMakeCache.txt

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Building:
  Linux:
    $ cmake /path/to/source
    $ make

  OS X:
    Same as Linux. Alternatively, Xcode projects could be built, but I have never tried or tested it

  Windows/MinGW (TDM-GCC)
     $ cmake /path/to/source -G "MinGW Makefiles"
     $ mingw32-make

  Windows/MinGW (MSYS, most likely with MinGW home installer"
     $ cmake /path/to/source -G "MSYS Makefiles"
     $ make

     To build 32 bit version, add -m32 to the CFLAGS when
     building. Add -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS="-m32" -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-m32" to the cmake build line.

  Windows/Visual Studio
     1. Use the cmake gui to generate VS projects
     2. Open the generated sln and build the project




--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


For building Linux binaries with against an old glibc for
compatability, install an old system in a chroot, but it's easier to
build using new tools (gcc, cmake etc.) outside of the chroot.

To do this install a chroot (mostly following these instructions
https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DebootstrapChroot for Hardy

To go even older, something is broken with debootstrap but you can get
cdebootstrap to work. You will need to edit
/usr/share/cdebootstrap/suites and copy one of the Ubuntu lines and
add the name of the old one you are trying to.
I had issues getting one installe older than breezy.

For building with very old glibcs, add -fgnu89-inline to CMAKE_C_FLAGS
to avoid multiple definitions (this is necessary with breezy)

# cdebootstrap --flavour=build --arch=i386 breezy /srv/chroot/breezy_i386 http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/

Make sure that gcc-multilib and g++-multilib are installed on the host
system. Inside the chroot install libssl-dev and freeglut3-dev, then do

  $ mkdir build_i386; cd build_i386
  $ cmake /path/to/source -DCMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH=/srv/chroot/hardy_i386 \
                                           -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=/usr/bin/gcc  \
                                           -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/usr/bin/g++ \
                                           -DCMAKE_AR=/usr/bin/ar  \
                                           -DCMAKE_RANLIB=/usr/bin/ranlib \
                                           -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS="-m32 --sysroot=/srv/chroot/hardy_i386/"  \
                                           -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-m32 --sysroot=/srv/chroot/hardy_i386/"
   $  make

for 64 bit
  $ mkdir build_amd64; cd build_amd64
  $ cmake /path/to/source -DCMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH=/srv/chroot/hardy_amd64 \
                                           -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=/usr/bin/gcc  \
                                           -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/usr/bin/g++ \
                                           -DCMAKE_AR=/usr/bin/ar  \
                                           -DCMAKE_RANLIB=/usr/bin/ranlib \
                                           -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS="-m64 --sysroot=/srv/chroot/hardy_amd64/"  \
                                           -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-m64 --sysroot=/srv/chroot/hardy_amd64/"
  $ make
