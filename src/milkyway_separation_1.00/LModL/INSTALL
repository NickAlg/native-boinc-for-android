Windows:

    MinGW:

        install msysgit:
            https://git.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/MSysGit:InstallMSysGit

        to get libraries such as editors refer to the MSYS and MinGW

        alternative GUI-based C/C++ editor - Notepad++
            -has tab-size control
            -allows changing indentation on highlighted blocks of text (shift
                tab reduces indent while tab increases)
            -able to translate unix-style and windows-style carriage returns
            -allows auto-indenting of entire file of code by clicking: TextFX
                ->TextFX Edit->Reindent C++ Code
            -many other popular features

            Notepad++ suggested configuration:

                Make sure indentation matches the code in MilkyWay@Home (auto
                    indent can be reconfigured to match any standard, but to
                    keep things simple it can be turned off):

                    settings->preferences
                        misc->auto-indent - uncheck
                        language menu/tab settings->tab settings - uncheck
                            'use default value', 'tab size' should be 4, check
                            'replace by space'
                        new document/default directory->format - select 'unix'

                Make sure trailing whitespace is removed on saving to avoid
                    merging problems with git:

                    settings->shortcut mapper->
                        main menu->save (right click)->modify - uncheck all
                            and change to 'none'
                        macros->trim trailing and save (right click)->modify
                            - uncheck all but ctrl, 's' should be selected

        Build instructions:

            go to "test" directory
            ./win_make_all

Mac:

    install gcc/g++ by downloading X-Code tools

        http://developer.apple.com/technologies/xcode.html

    install SDL (http://www.libsdl.org/) and git

        port install libsdl-devel git-core

        Build instructions:

            go to "test" directory
            ./mac_make_all

Linux:

    install gcc/g++ development packages, git, and SDL (http://www.libsdl.org/)

        Linux:

            sudo yum install gcc-c++ git-core SDL-devel.i686

        Ubuntu:

            sudo apt-get install build-essential git-core libsdl1.2-dev

            to check for a new revision of SDL to insert in the place of "libsdl1.2-dev" above, use the following command

                apt-cache search libsdl

        Build instructions:

            go to "test" directory
            ./lin_make_all

Other platforms:

    Install gcc/g++ development packages, git, and SDL (http://www.libsdl.org/)

Other compilers:

    Other compilers supported with SDL (including MSVC) should also compile and run LModL
