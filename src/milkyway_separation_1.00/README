--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Separation:

  - separation will do a separation after the integration if given an
    output file. There is also an argument to set the random number seed.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nbody:

  - Consistent N-body results between different systems require crlibm
  and SSE2 (at least on x86, not sure about other architectures)

  - Returning nil from makePotential() for N-body will run the
    simulation without an external potential

Tests can be run by running:
  $ make test

  However this runs all of the tests, which takes forever. You can run
  (from the tests directory) some core functionality tests with:
  $ make check

  Other tests  can be run with a certain number of bodies depending on
  how long you want to wait with:

  $ make test_${n}

  Currently n = 100, 1024, 10000 are available.

Random notes:

 - All give usage with --help/-? arguments

make nbody_release and make separation_release will produce release
tarballs if git and xz are installed and found.

- Make sure when building with MSVC to set built to use Multithreaded
  (/MT) for the builds of the various libraries
