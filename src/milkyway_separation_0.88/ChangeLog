separation 0.80:
	- GPU checkpointing for CAL and OpenCL builds
	- New arguments to disable GPU checkpointing: --gpu-disable-checkpointing
	- SSE2 intrinsics
	- Different SSE levels all in one binary
	- New optional Lua parameters file
	- Better chunking for CAL and OpenCL builds
	- Better automated tests
	- Argument --responsiveness-factor removed
	- Argument --non-responsive added (use with caution)
	- Arguments for controlling which path is used (--force-x87, --force-sse2, --force-sse3, --force-no-intrinsics)


nbody 0.40:
	- Replace JSON config file with Lua
	- Support for arbitrary initial distributions with Lua
	- Bindings to old utility functions for Plummer sphere, timestep calculation, eps2 etc.
	- Simulation can now be run with no background potential
	- Fix "No error" message for some checkpointing failures on Windows
	- Improved partial automated testing (mostly incomplete)
	- Add option to silence tree structure errors
	- No longer immediately aborts on tree structure errors
	- Add argument to prevent BOINC from eating stderr
	- Fix conflicts with Apple headers when using Macports GCC
	- Checkpointing no longer requires initial config file (likely to change again)
	- Checkpointing now works without BOINC
